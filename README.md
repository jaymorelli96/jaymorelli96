Hi, I'm Jay, a passionate software engineer
---------------------------

I’m a devoted software engineer who finds joy in the art of craftsmanship. Currently, working @PaddleHQ at the Payments team.

Besides work, you’ll catch me fine-tuning my configurations, such as my NeoVim and terminal setup. I also love learning and sharing my insights, which is part of the reason why I created this website. Outside the digital world, I enjoy playing board games with my fiancée and doing outdoor activities like surfing, running, or cycling.
