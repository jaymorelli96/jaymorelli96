Aspiring Software Craftsman
---------------------------

I'm a software engineer with a passion for the art of software craftsmanship and mastering new technologies. Currently working with the Java/Spring ecosystem for Colt Technology Services. I've also received the following certifications: Java OCP 8, AWS Cloud Practitioner, Azure Fundamentals, OCI Foundations Associate and OCI Architect Associate. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to apply my skills to real-world problems. In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies, cycling, surfing, and playing board games with my fiancée. I'm also open to collaborating with other developers and recently started my journey to contributing to open-source projects. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat!
