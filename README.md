Hi, I'm Jay, a passionate software engineer
---------------------------

I’m a devoted software engineer who finds joy in the art of craftsmanship. Specializing in Go, my favorite programming language, I’m currently working at Siemens in the Industrial Edge, where I have the opportunity to contribute to architectural decisions and thrive in a dynamic project team.

Besides work, you’ll catch me fine-tuning my configurations, such as my NeoVim and terminal setup. I also love learning and sharing my insights, which is part of the reason why I created this website. Outside the digital world, I enjoy playing board games with my fiancée and doing outdoor activities like surfing, running, or cycling.

For me, passion is the driving force that transforms the entire process into an enjoyable journey.
